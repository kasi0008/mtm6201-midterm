            Pomegranate ice cream is the perfect blend of sweet and tart. Refreshing on a hot summer day, and a delightful after dinner dessert or any time of the year. We have an ice cream maker, therefore we love to experiment with new flavors. I've been wanting to try pomegranate for while now. This pomegranate ice cream has bold flavor. It's tart and sweet, and super creamy. Ice cream, ice cream, we all scream for ice cream! And you'll definitely be screaming for Pomegranate Ice Cream!! Another one of my favorite things in the summer is ice cream. I really do like it year round, I mean, who doesn't? But something about the hot summer sun makes me crave cold creaminess on my tongue and It. Is. Delightful.

            The concept takes a basic vanilla frozen custard and blends it with Grape-Nuts, which are the malt-flavored remnants of wheat-and-barley loaves that've been baked, dried and crushed. The pellets soften slightly in the custard, much akin to the way they do in a bowl of cereal milk, creating a balance of creamy, sweet, crunchy, salty and malty. Adding Grape-Nuts to ice cream is basically injecting whole grains, vitamins and fiber into one of America's favorite junk foods, which is the perfect juxtaposition of everything we love. To get a taste of Grape-Nuts ice cream outside of New England, your best bet is making it in your own kitchen.

            â€‹Blueberry ice cream, I cannot believe the colour that you get from blueberry ice cream, it is so amazingly beautiful. This ice cream is delicious, it is creamy, easy to scoop out and is a perfect summer treat. But here's a secret, if you are like me and you eat ice cream in winter in front of the heater, you can make it with frozen blueberries, so it is actually a year round ice cream. The taste of the blueberries will determine the outcome of your icecream. Use flavoursome small blueberries, they seem to work best. They give the ice cream a great flavour. I have used really large blueberries, that were very mild flavoured blueberries and the ice cream was light in blueberry flavour, tasted like vanilla ice cream to be honest, but just serve them with fresh blueberries on the side and that problem is fixed. So my advice pick the fresh small flavoursome blueberries, or go with frozen.
